# 🧠 Impractical Python Projects — Inspired by Lee Vaughan

Welcome to a repository of wonderfully *impractical* brilliance!  
This project collection is based on **_Impractical Python Projects: Playful Programming Activities to Make You Smarter_** by **Lee Vaughan** — a No Starch Press classic that turns curious coding experiments into brain-stretching fun.

Each folder corresponds to a chapter in the book, with code listings and variations inspired by the exercises. Whether you’re exploring probability puzzles, simulating alien life, or building text adventures, this repo captures the spirit of learning through play.

## 🪐 Personal Note

This repository serves as both a reference and a creative sandbox — a way to revisit and expand upon Vaughan’s imaginative exercises using modern Python and my own explorations.  

It’s a reminder that coding doesn’t always have to be *practical* to be *profoundly educational.*
