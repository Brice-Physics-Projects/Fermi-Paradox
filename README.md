## 🧭 Versioning (Scientific Milestone Model)

This project uses **milestone-based versioning** aligned with scientific development stages:

- **v0.x — Exploration Phase**  
  Architecture creation, Drake Equation engine, initial notebooks, and documentation foundation.

- **v1.x — Simulation Phase**  
  Galaxy-level simulations, probabilistic modeling, visualization outputs.

- **v2.x — Machine Learning Phase**  
  Surrogate models, signal classifiers, inference endpoints.

- **v3.x — Publication Phase**  
  Stable release, refined UI, full documentation, deployment.

### Current Milestone

>**v0.1 — Project Framework & Scientific Foundations**

- Core architecture established  
- Drake Equation module implemented

---

## ⭐ Overview

The **Fermi Paradox Project** is an interactive scientific platform that explores one of the most enduring questions in astrophysics:

> **If intelligent civilizations should be common in the galaxy, why don’t we see evidence of them?**

This application lets users:

- Experiment with the **Drake Equation**
- Run **Monte Carlo galaxy simulations**
- Explore early **probability-based signal detection**
- Learn the scientific reasoning behind astrobiology models
- (Soon) Use **machine learning** surrogates and signal classifiers

It combines backend engineering, astrophysics, visualization, and scientific documentation into a cohesive, research-friendly tool.

## ⭐ Inspiration & Acknowledgment

This project began as a **simple CLI exercise inspired by** a chapter in Lee Vaughan’s *Impractical Python Projects*.  
Since then, it has evolved into:

- a Flask web application  
- a scientific simulation engine  
- a documented research platform  
- a future ML testbed  

The current architecture, scientific logic, simulations, and extensions are **original contributions** built far beyond the scope of the book.

## ⭐ Why This Project Matters

This application blends the following strengths:

- Backend engineering  
- Scientific curiosity  
- Modeling & probability  
- Clear documentation  
- Architectural understanding  
- ML-forward thinking  

It is both:

🧪 **A scientific tool**  
💼 **A portfolio-quality engineering project**
