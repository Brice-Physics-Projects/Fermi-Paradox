    This web app explores one of the most intriguing questions in science:

    <em>“If the galaxy is full of stars and planets, where is everybody?”</em>

  <p>
    <strong>Drake’s Number (N)</strong> estimates how many civilizations in our galaxy are capable of sending
    detectable radio signals. It’s calculated using the
    <a href="{{ url_for('api.get_drake_number') }}">Drake Equation</a>,
    which combines astronomical and biological probabilities to model the odds of communication between civilizations.
  </p>
  <p>
    The equation considers the rate of star formation, the fraction of stars with planets, the number of
    habitable worlds, and the likelihood that life, intelligence, and detectable technology emerge and persist.

  <h2 class="text-accent mb-3">🧮 Drake’s Number</h2>
  <p>
    Dive deeper into each factor of the equation and see how small changes in assumptions can dramatically
    alter our estimate of potential communicating civilizations.

    calculations, and justifications for each parameter.

  <h2 class="text-accent mb-3">🪐 Galaxy Simulator</h2>
  <p>
    Visualize our Milky Way galaxy and the distribution of hypothetical civilizations.
    The simulator scales the galactic volume and represents each civilization’s radio
    “bubble,” showing how likely they are to overlap and detect each other.
  </p>
  <p>
    🔭 Visit the <a href="#">Galaxy Simulator</a> to see the Milky Way rendered as a digital starfield.

  <h2 class="text-accent mb-3">📈 Probability Detection Model</h2>
  <p>
    This section models the <strong>probability of interstellar detection</strong> — the odds that one
    civilization’s signals overlap with another’s. Based on Monte Carlo simulations and polynomial regression,
    it offers a quantitative look at how vast space limits communication opportunities.
